### Lowther and District Men's Shed

Hi All, we had some great news today, Paul SLC Phoned me this afternoon and asked me if I had checked my emails, I said no why?  he told me that our application for the Community Led Local Development Fund " CLLD " has been approved, the funding will help us complete the project.

Many thanks once again to Paul Creechan SLC Men's Shed, our chairperson Bob Lowden, the committee, and all L&DMS Members for your support, we have all worked so hard to get to this point.

Best Regards

Nigel.
