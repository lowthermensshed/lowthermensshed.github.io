## Tonights Meeting 

Hi All, Bob our chairperson has tested positive for covid today and I have been in close contact with him, not feeling to good today myself, although I have tested negative this morning. 
I think it would be wise to cancel tonights meeting and reshedule it for next Friday 22nd september. Very sorry for any inconvenience but I think its wise to be carefull.

So please spread the word today

Best Regards
