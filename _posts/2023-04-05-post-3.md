Hi to all you Shedders 
(notice the correct spelling of "shedders", and if there are any further spelling mistakes "sorry". 
The first meeting will be held in the Leadhills Library Friday 14th April 2023 6:30pm and a good turnout would be gratefully appreciated. 
I Have been busy working on sketches, talking to scottish power, scottish water, together with south lanarkshire planning regarding the site. 
Bob and I met lads from other sheds last week and an open invitation to all who would like to visit them, I will get a list together for the meeting.

I must thank Ewan for his help. My computer skills are not the best,many thanks Ewan.

Please try to attend the meeting as it is so important to get off to a good start. 

LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN, 
Nigel
