Hi all, I would like to thank all for turning up to our first meeting, and for the apologies sent, we now have a full committee. 

The first committee meeting will be at my house. and all will be welcome it's not just for committee member's so come along and have your say. 

(Nigels house is 2 Gowanbank, the back of the house is near the cemetary and has the big garage. There should be parking near the cemetary. The meeting will be in the garage)

FRIDAY 5th MAY 2023, 6:30pm 

Many thanks Nigel
