# Lowther and District Men's Shed

Good Afternoon Members
We are ready to begin internal painting of the `Hub` area of the men`s shed starting approx 10am on Sunday March 9th.
Myself & Nigel will be opening up around 9.30am.
If you are available we will be pleased to see you there, please wear old clothes.
We have two coats of white u/coat & 2 coats of grey emulsion, obviously we will only attempt to complete the first coat on Sunday.
If like me you tire after maybe 3 hours that would be fine, so if some members want to come a bit later they could take over from the first group.
All material will be supplied inc. Roller,Brushes & Paint.
 
Regards,
J.R.Lowdon.
