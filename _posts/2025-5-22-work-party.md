# Lowther and District Men's Shed
# Work Party
## SUNDAY: 25/05/2025. 10am to 2pm at the shed. 4, Ramsay road, Leadhills

Hello members, we are having a work party this Sunday, we need to get the workshop is some kind of order, also move the collected tools in my garage over the last couple of years down to the shed workshop so we can sort them out, also there is some tidying up works outside. So, if you could give a little time, we will be there from 10am-2pm. Thanks Nigel.
