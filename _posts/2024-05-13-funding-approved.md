# Lowther and District Men's Shed
 
Hi all, great news, the sheds on the move!  

Many thanks to all, we have received a confirmation letter from the Community Development fund, confirming we have been offered funding to remove the Building from the Lowther Hill and store on the site in Leadhills. 

We will be collating more information and Photos for a press release shortly; we will be taking photos on both sites this Friday morning 17/05/2024 gathering at my house ( 2,Gowanbank, Leadhills ML12 6YB ) for 10am so please come along your support would be appreciated.
