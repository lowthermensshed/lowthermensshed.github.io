Hi to all Shed men, just an update, we have had a super response to my first post as you can see we have changed the name to Include all in the Lowther and surrounding area, we are moving forward and have our constitution in place, next step is to open a bank account.

I have spoken to Donald Noble factor Hopetoun Estates and we hope to meet very soon to discuss a possible site for the shed.

We are hopefully going to have our first meeting and form a committee, I will keep you all informed of the date and time, please,please try and attend, as we need all the support we can get, cos if we don't push we won't get it.

Many thanks Nigel

Many thanks and lets make it happen
