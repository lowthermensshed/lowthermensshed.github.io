# Lowther and District Men's Shed
## Sunday 13/04/2025 between 10:00 – 14:00 At the shed. 4, Ramsay Road, Leadhills.

Good morning to all, with the shed being in the last stages of completion and the main contractor just about complete with a few small jobs to do, the shed is looking GREAT. 

At our last meeting it was agreed that the opening date of the shed will be 28th May 2025, 2:30pm. 

With this in mind, I am asking if anybody with a couple of hours to spare this Sunday 13/04/2025 between 10:00 – 14:00 and would like to help us tidy up, carry out some small painting jobs, sort out the workshop and tools we have been donated, would be good to see you ( maybe a cake or two ) 

Many thanks 

Nigel.
