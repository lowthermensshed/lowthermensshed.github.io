# Lowther and District Men's Shed
 
Latest update on Lowther hill Building. 

We had a meeting with our Building contractor at the weekend and agreed that the work to dismantle the Lowther Building will start on Monday 17/06/2024. 

We have contacted all the necessary Parties, all members and interested Parties are welcome to come up the hill and watch the start of the project. 

I will post more information nearer the time. 

Well done to all, WE MADE IT HAPPEN. 

Nigel, Secretary, LDMS.
